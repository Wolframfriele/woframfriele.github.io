# Static website build with Zola

This serves as my personal website, with this readme including some of the design decisions.

# Requirements

- Must have home page with short description
- Room for blog / posts
- support for codeblocks
- support for tags
- higher then 99 in lighthouse
- no errors in pingdom
- Small page weight, (need actual number)

# Nice to haves

- Search option
- code block copy
- Some sort of email obfuscator?
    - Do I even need my email on here?

# Cool to add

- A list of sources that inspire me, that shows three links/topics that changes on every reload.
