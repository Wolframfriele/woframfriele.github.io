    "projectContext": "This reel also landed me a job with Media Monks where I had the chance to work in an international team for large clients. I learned a ton of professional skills like: design thinking, client communication, working across timezones and managing expectations. This showreel is a reflection of the work after an internship with Onesize and the Mograph Mentor course. Some of the work is from personal projects and some of it is part of commercial work. I spent quite a bit of time on building a good intro / outro, and I'm very happy with the results.",
