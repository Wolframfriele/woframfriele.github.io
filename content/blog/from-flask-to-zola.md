## Outline
- Introduction
    Possible ideas is talking about how every new websites first post is a blog post about the website.

- Reasons for changing the website
    - Focus on sharing information instead of just showing finished projects
    - Further optimize performance / ethics of pageweight / solar website
    - A place to share things that I am excited about

There is only one true kind of first blog post for people writing in the development space, and that is a post about how the website that the post is on was build. With a bit of luck this post will be buried under tons of interesting other articles. But it also often happens that there will be only a few, as it turns out that the person likes building software more than they like writing about it. Only time will tell where this blog ends up!

## Why did I want to change the website again? 

Let's first talk about the reasons that led me to change my website once again.

### Flask

When I started at the University for applied science, the first project we were supposed to work on was a personal website. Or as the school dubbed it, a portfolio website. Since I have a long history as a motion designer, I have had plenty of portfolio websites, this started out with flash [^1] but ended with some sort of wordpress template that I custimized . But the idea of building something truly custom seemed exciting. Since my goal at the time was getting into machine learning the logical choice was to learn python. So I simply looked at python webframeworks and settled on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). One of the major reasons was that it was relatively light, and there was a great tutorial about how to actually make anything with it by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). 

### Svelte

The next iteration was a svelte page.

### Zola

Now I'm turning to zola; a static site generator.

[^1] I wish I could find the source files somewhere, but I'm afraid they have been lost to time.
