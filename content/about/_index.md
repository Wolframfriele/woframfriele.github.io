_I'm working on systems that combine, transform and analyze data to improve infrastructure. Currently interning at Siemens Mobility, where I am analyzing brake recuperation of trams._

I'm a former [3D-animator](https://vimeo.com/261704101) who used to work in the advertising industry. While I still think animation is incredible, after 8 years working in the industry I was starting to feel tired making advertisements. I had always enjoyed the technical aspects of 3D-animation, and had become the go-to person on my team when people needed help debugging scenes. When a former colleague responded to a brief introduction I had written about myself for a pitch deck with "Dude, you sound like an engineer, let me rewrite that for you,” something in the statement stuck

In 2020 I decided to follow that thread and make a career change. I started studying Open-ICT at the Hogeschool Utrecht, a new project-based program that has given me the opportunity to work on some interesting real-world applications. For the Ripe NCC I attempted [to detect problems](https://ripe84.ripe.net/archives/video/798/) in neighboring [Autonomous Systems](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/as-numbers/). For [Yunex Traffic](https://nl.yunextraffic.com/) I built a scalable traffic prediction system based on road loop detector data from the [NDW](https://www.ndw.nu/). I’m currently at [Siemens Mobility](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/nl/nl.html), where I'm analyzing brake recuperation data from trams with the goal of finding opportunities to further increase the amount of recuperated energy.

Outside of work you’ll find me training for [endurance sports](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35339524), in the summer of 2023 I finished the Race Around the Netherlands in [7 days and 10 hours](https://www.adventurebikeracing.com/ratngx/#results). Other than that I love building and repairing things, from bikes to furniture to keyboards.
