Currently working as a software engineer at <a href=https://www.technolution.com/>Technolution</a>.</em><hr><img alt="Portrait of Wolfram Friele" sizes="(max-width: 52rem) 380px, 768px" srcset="https://wolframfriele.com/processed_images/portrait-wolf.3259dd629dfcb201.webp 380w, https://wolframfriele.com/about/portrait-wolf.webp 768w" height=413 src=https://wolframfriele.com/about/portrait-wolf.webp width=768><p>I'm a former <a href=https://vimeo.com/261704101>3D-animator</a> who used to work in the advertising industry. While I still think animation is incredible, after 8 years working in the industry I was starting to feel tired making advertisements. I had always enjoyed the technical aspects of 3D-animation, and had become the go-to person on my team when people needed help debugging scenes. When a former colleague responded to a brief introduction I had written about myself for a pitch deck with "Dude, you sound like an engineer, let me rewrite that for you,” something in the statement stuck<p>In 2020 I decided to follow that thread and make a career change. I started studying Open-ICT at the Hogeschool Utrecht, a new project-based program that has given me the opportunity to work on some interesting real-world applications. For the Ripe NCC I attempted <a href=https://ripe84.ripe.net/archives/video/798/>to detect problems</a> in neighboring <a href=https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/as-numbers/>Autonomous Systems</a>. For <a href=https://nl.yunextraffic.com/>Yunex Traffic</a> I built a scalable traffic prediction system based on road loop detector data from the <a href=https://www.ndw.nu/>NDW</a>. I’m currently at <a href=https://www.mobility.siemens.com/nl/nl.html>Siemens Mobility</a>, where I'm analyzing brake recuperation data from trams with the goal of finding opportunities to further increase the amount of recuperated energy.<p>Outside of work you’ll find me training for <a href=https://www.strava.com/athletes/35339524>endurance sports</a>, in the summer of 2023 I finished the Race Around the Netherlands in <a href=https://www.adventurebikeracing.com/ratngx/#results>7 days and 10 hours</a>. Other than that I love building and repairing things, from bikes to furniture to keyboards.</main><footer><div id=links><a href=https://github.com/Wolframfriele>GitHub</a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolframfriele/>LinkedIn</a><a href=https://github.com/Wolframfriele/wolframfriele.github.io/issues/new>Feedback</a><a href=https://wolframfriele.com/privacy-policy/>Privacy Policy</a></div></footer>
