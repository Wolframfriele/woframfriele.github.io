            Our team was tasked with creating a reservation system for In-Ki
            Shiatsu. The main goal was to lower the barrier for making an
            appointment. This meant that we wanted to reduce the for making an
            appointment and show availability as quickly in the process as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the backend we used Django, to make API entrypoints. Then on the
            frontend we used Vue.js to make API calls. This was my first time
            developing full stack with dedicated front and backend. My main role
            was that off frontend developer, when I started out I hands-on close
            to zero experience with javascript, let alone javascript frameworks.
            This project was a great way to dive headfirst into fullstack
            development.

        <h1 class="title-left">Making an appointment</h1>

        <p class="paragraph-left">
          For the customer facing part of this project we wanted to show
          available appointments as soon as possible. While researching other
          reservation systems one of the major frustrations where long sets off
          questions we had to answer before seeing availability.<br />
          As our UI would be part of the Shiatsu Studio's website, color schemes
          had to match and lay-outs had to be very simmple since context would
          be provided by the rest of the page.

        <p class="paragraph-right">
          Near the end of the project I also worked on some off the API's and
          the dashboard for the therapist. The system has options for seeing
          booked appointments, planning new appointments, blocking appointments,
          changing customer info and planning vacation.
