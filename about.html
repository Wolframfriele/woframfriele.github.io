                    I spent the last 8 years working as a 3D motion designer in Amsterdam.
                    I’ve gotten tired of making advertisements for a living, so I’m making the switch to the world of AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I’m attending the Hogeschool Utrecht to learn more about software and artificial intelligence.
                    In the future, I want to work for a purpose-driven organization that sees the
                    power of AI to make the world a little better.

                    When not at school or work, you’ll find me puzzling through a bouldering
                    problem or running through the woods.

                        <em>
                            At Onesize I work in a small team to help companies like 
                            Under Armour and Adidas make beautiful commercials. 
                            Because we are a small team, I have to wear a lot of hats 
                            while working and have a broad set of responsibilities.

                            At MediaMonks I worked in the 25-person animation team. 
                            With international clients and colleagues, I learned how to 
                            act and deliver in a high stakes, fast-paced environment.

                        <em>
                            I’d dreamed of working at Onesize ever since I was a kid, 
                            so an internship with the company was an amazing opportunity. 
                            My first 6 months at Onesize pushed me to a new level in my 
                            animation skills and were a great introduction into 
                            the world of employment.

                        <em>
                            Wallfiller was an animation studio that specialized in projection 
                            mappings. We worked with clients like Rabobank, Björn Borg, 
                            and Philips. What’s most remarkable about my time as an entrepreneur 
                            was that I changed from being an unmotivated and frustrated student 
                            into someone who loved to learn. I also learned how business works, 
                            how to plan projects, and how to make clients happy.

                        In this course, you'll dissect the internal machinery of artificial
                        neural nets through hands-on experimentation, not hairy
                        mathematics. You'll develop intuition about the kinds of problems
                        they are suited to solve, and by the end you’ll be ready to dive
                        into the algorithms, or build one for yourself.
